/**
 * @class KIconLoader kiconloader.h KIconLoader
 *
 * Iconloader for KDE.
 *
 * @note For most icon loading use cases perfer using QIcon::fromTheme
 *
 * KIconLoader will load the current icon theme and all its base themes.
 * Icons will be searched in any of these themes. Additionally, it caches
 * icons and applies effects according to the user's preferences.
 *
 * In KDE, it is encouraged to load icons by "Group". An icon group is a
 * location on the screen where icons are being used. Standard groups are:
 * Desktop, Toolbar, MainToolbar, Small and Panel. Each group can have some
 * centrally-configured effects applied to its icons. This makes it possible
 * to offer a consistent icon look in all KDE applications.
 *
 * The standard groups are defined below.
 *
 * @li KIconLoader::Desktop: Icons in the iconview of konqueror, kdesktop and similar apps.
 * @li KIconLoader::Toolbar: Icons in toolbars.
 * @li KIconLoader::MainToolbar: Icons in the main toolbars.
 * @li KIconLoader::Small: Various small (typical 16x16) places: titlebars, listviews
 * and menu entries.
 * @li KIconLoader::Panel: Icons in kicker's panel
 *
 * The icons are stored on disk in an icon theme or in a standalone
 * directory. The icon theme directories contain multiple sizes and/or
 * depths for the same icon. The iconloader will load the correct one based
 * on the icon group and the current theme. Icon themes are stored globally
 * in share/icons, or, application specific in share/apps/$appdir/icons.
 *
 * The standalone directories contain just one version of an icon. The
 * directories that are searched are: $appdir/pics and $appdir/toolbar.
 * Icons in these directories can be loaded by using the special group
 * "User".
 *
